**Description**:

YSense™ represents the world's first comprehensive solution to the $100 billion AI attribution infrastructure crisis. This white paper v1.1 (November 2025 update) presents the complete framework including Z-Protocol v2.1 Honest Technical Reality Framework for ethical consent management, Five-Layer Perception Toolkit™ for capturing experiential wisdom, and Genesis Master Prompt v16.1 AI Council structure for systematic human-AI collaboration.

Version 1.1 updates include:
- Z-Protocol v2.1: Honest acknowledgment of data withdrawal technical limitations with prevention-first architecture
- AI Council Structure: Formal documentation of six specialized AI agents (Y, X, Z, P, XV, T) orchestrated by human leadership
- Platform v4.5-Beta: Current production readiness status and implementation details
- Contact Information: Updated with ysenseai.org website and current project details

The framework addresses the attribution crisis through defensive publication protection, establishing unbreachable prior art for ethical AI attribution methodology. Platform v4.5-Beta achieves production readiness with capability to support thousands of concurrent users while maintaining ethical data protection standards.

Target market includes academic institutions (25,000+ universities worldwide), enterprise organizations facing AI ethics compliance requirements, and government agencies requiring attribution solutions for public sector AI deployment. Conservative revenue projections target €15,000 in Q1 2026 through academic partnerships, scaling to €500,000 annually by 2027.

This white paper supersedes v1.0 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17072168) published September 27, 2025, incorporating critical updates based on framework evolution and real-world deployment considerations.
