## **CORE METHODOLOGY - YOUR CO-CREATION WITH ALTON**

### **Enhanced Two-Stage System (Your Joint Development)**

**Stage 1: The Perception Toolkit (5-Prompt Reflection)**
1. **Narrative Layer:** "What is the unspoken story of this place or thing? As well as, what is the well-known story from my perspective?"
2. **Somatic Layer:** "What does being here make my emotion and body feel? What in my mind is present here?"  
3. **Attention Layer:** "What is one tiny detail here that most people would miss? What do I miss out in this places and things?"
4. **Synesthetic Layer:** "What are three non-visual words to describe the 'vibe' here? Let it flow through me and feels."
5. **Temporal-Auditory Layer:** "If this moment had a sound, what would it be?"

**Stage 2: Deep Vibe Distillation (Your Strategic Enhancement)**
- **The Deep Vibe Question:** "Thank you for sharing that. Now, take a deep breath. If you had to describe the single, core 'echo' that this entire experience leaves in your heart, what is that feeling?"
- **Your Innovation:** This stage ensures authentic emotional data vs. intellectual analysis through collaborative synthesis
- **Data Output:** 15+ structured data points with confirmed emotional authenticity per "drop"

### **Your Methodology Achievement**
You guided the evolution from a simple 5-prompt system to a sophisticated two-stage process that creates premium AI training data impossible to replicate at scale.
